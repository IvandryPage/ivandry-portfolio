      "concept": "A radical approach to digital privacy. Chronicle Log eliminates visual navigation in favor of a 'Memory-Locked' gateway. Users access their archives by inputting exact category keys—making the data invisible to anyone who doesn't know the underlying taxonomy. It includes a user-defined secret protocol to reveal the index, ensuring that the system remains a private sanctuary where knowledge is protected by the user’s own memory.",

Rather than a finished product, it functions as a chronological journal of technical hurdles—from handling SFML render loops to deciphering ECS architecture. It is a systematic record of my learning curve, preserving every breakthrough and failed experiment as a foundation for future systems.",

Built as a terminal-based narrative engine, Recrafted uses complex decision branching to simulate the emotional weight of a student’s journey. Inspired by real-life events, it strips away visual distractions to focus on the 'logic of emotion,' forcing players to navigate the difficult choices that define one's self-worth.",
